# Challenge-5_Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
For this project, the objective was to analyze ride-sharing data; first by the type of city (rural, suburban, and urban) and find the total amount of rides, drivers, fares, and the average fare amount by ride and by driver for each city type. In the second part, part of data was converted into a datetime data type in order to measure the total weekly fare amounts between early January and the end of April. This was then made into a graph.
## Results 

### City Type Summary

In terms of the number of riders and drivers, the number of people in both sections are the least in rural areas, and rise as one goes to suburban areas, and even more to the transition to urban areas. This in itself is not surprising, as rural cities tend to have the least amount of population of the three groups, while suburban cities have more, and urban cities have even more than suburban cities. With that, the total fare amount is the least in rural cities, is even more in urban cities. However, the average fare amounts per rider and driver are the highest in rural cities. The average suburban city fare amount is somewhat less than average rural city fare amounts, with the average fare per driver being notably less. In comparison to suburban cities, the average urban city fare amount is also somewhat less and the average fare per driver is also notably lower.

### Total Weekly Fare Amount by Month

Starting with the beginning of the year, the total weekly fare amounts, for all city types, tend to rise until their peak in late February, from where they generally steadily decline until the end of the April, the end of the selected period of measure. Two notable data points, one is the suburban city type, which sees its total fare amount rise around after the first week in April. The other is the rural city type which sees its highest peak at around the beginning of April.
## Summary

### Part 1
One reason for the difference between the fare amounts between the city types is likely due to a supply and demand issue. Since rural cities tend to have less people overall, they simultaneously have less people in demand of rides and a lower supply of drives. Average fare amounts tend to decrease as the supply of drivers and the amount of riders increases in higher population density suburban and urban city types. One proposal to decrease the different average fares between the city would be to try to lower the rides to driver ratio (which is highest in rural cities) by trying to have more drivers available for specific times in the rural and suburban city types. In this way, having more drivers available in specific times can probably help offest some of the higher costs, especially if they are from the cities they are doing rideshares. 

### Part 2
While this data does not highlight the starting and ending locations per ride, less densely populated areas likely have a greater distance between starting and ending locations, with the rural city type having the greatest ride distances with suburban cities having the second most. Another proposal would be to try carpooling methods. In this way, this can drop the average fare per ride while raising the amount a driver can make. Finally, since rural rides also usually require more fuel for travel, there could be a fuel reimbursement initiative for drivers who drive longer distances. While the average fare per driver is more for drivers who make rural trips, they also will spend more on fuel; this would help ride coverage increase for rural riders and might even bring in more riders.
