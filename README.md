# Challenge-5_Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
For this project, the objective was to analyze ride-sharing data; first by the type of city (rural, suburban, and urban) and find the total amount of rides, drivers, fares, and the average fare amount by ride and by driver for each city type. In the second part, part of data was converted into a datetime data type in order to measure the total weekly fare amounts between early January and the end of April. This was then made into a graph.
